            | Hi,
          p.
            My name is Emory Hare, and I am searching for a web development position in the NC Triangle area. With some educational background in programming and newly acquired skills in front-end web development, I am excited to find the right place where I can apply my knowledge and skills in the profession. 
          p.
            In the past year, I have studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online courses. I have completed web projects and learned about associated frameworks (Bootstrap, jQuery, React) and preprocessors (Pug/Jade, Sass). This website is my first personal project in which I combine and apply these skills. 
          p.
            As an entry level/junior developer, I am seeking a collaborative workplace that encourages growth and learning. In terms of my work style, I am easy-going, adaptable, and creative, so I am looking for a work environment and team that are flexible and welcoming of new ideas.
          p
            | Thanks for checking out my site,

        p.
          I have always been driven by my curiosity and desire to create, and computers have piqued my interest since I can remember. Though my path up to this point has taken unexpected turns, I’m really excited to finally pursue a career that allows me to return to my love of computers and grants me the opportunity to use my creativity. My previous position with the UNC School of Law Office of Advancement was a great opportunity for me right out of college, but I soon realized that it was not the right fit for the long-term. This was when I decided to take the plunge and take the time to get back into programming, and web development seemed like just the right fit for my path forward. 
        p.
          Personally, I’m the type of person who is driven by my passions. If something piques my interest, I want to learn everything I can about it. I throw myself in completely and put my all into it. This has led me to have a diverse set of interests and hobbies (and admittedly a little too much knowledge about Pokemon). Web development is something that was initially a personal interest but has grown into what I want to pursue as my career, which makes me really excited for the possibility to pursue a passion as a profession. 
        p.
          In my free time, I like to research and learn about new technology, play video games, play tennis, play guitar, and spend time with my family (which includes 2 cats).
